# Formatting Boundary

## Scope

Choose standard-library formatting or fmtlib by product role and consumer
boundary, not by the directory containing the code.

## Hard Rules

1. **Required public and installed APIs use standard-library formatting only.**
   Public signatures and macros, required formatter hooks, installed headers'
   required compile paths, exported targets, and package dependency files must
   not require fmtlib.
2. **Optional public fmtlib extensions are consumer opt-in.** They must be
   optional at compile time, leave the normal public API usable without fmtlib,
   and add no public or exported fmt dependency.
3. **Internal implementation and final terminal programs use fmtlib by
   default.** Preserve direct standard-library paths at real standard-library
   boundaries. Do not add adapters or duplicate formatter stacks merely to
   satisfy the default.
4. **Examples use standard-library formatting and output.** They demonstrate
   the required public API and must not add fmtlib includes or target
   dependencies.
5. **Tests match the behavior under test.** Use standard-library formatting for
   required standard-library public contracts and fmtlib for optional extension
   behavior or concise internal test diagnostics.
6. **Use the selected library's mature API directly.** Prefer its formatting,
   printing, append, and buffer facilities over mixing formatted strings into a
   second output abstraction without a local reason.
7. **Error construction follows [error-handling.md](error-handling.md).** This
   reference chooses the library boundary; error handling decides whether a
   fixed message, project helper, or custom constructor is warranted.

## Dependency Visibility

fmtlib linkage follows the same boundary: private for internal implementation
and final terminal programs, absent from examples and required public/exported
dependencies. Before adding an include or target dependency, verify that fmtlib
is present in the project's dependency declaration and give the owning target
the narrowest correct visibility.

The required public std-only boundary takes precedence over the internal fmtlib
default. For an exported static library, `PRIVATE` does not remove the final
consumer's link dependency: CMake retains it for transitive linking. Check the
installed consumer path; use standard-library formatting in that required
implementation path when fmtlib would otherwise become a required exported
dependency. See [CMake static libraries](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake-buildsystem.7.html#static-libraries).

If the project does not yet provide fmtlib, this preference does not by itself
authorize a dependency change. When the current task actually requires choosing
or adding the internal formatting facility, recommend fmtlib by default and
apply the project's dependency-change rules.
